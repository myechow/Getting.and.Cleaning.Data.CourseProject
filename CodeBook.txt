The script "run_analysis.R" contains the code which is used to create a tidy dataset containing multiple text files from  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. The script follows five steps to complete the assignment. The training and test sets text files are measured as each variable and merged as mean and standard deviation for each measurement. The descriptive activity name used to label the activities in the data set. A second tidy data set is created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Variables for the tidy dataset from their text files:
	features <- features.txt (List of all features.)
	activities <- activity_labels.txt (Links the class labels with their activity name.)
	subject_test <- subject_test.txt (Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.)
	X_test <- test/X_test.txt (Training set.)
	y_test <- test/y_test.txt (Training labels.)
	subject_train <- subject_train.txt (Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.) 
	X_train <- test/X_train.txt (Training set.)
	y_train <- test/y_train.txt (Training labels.)
 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set:
	X forms by merging x_train and x_test using bind() function.
	Y forms d by merging y_train and y_test using bind() function.
	Subject forms by merging subject_train and subject_test using bind() function.
	Dataset forms by merging Subject, Y, and X using bind() function.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement:
	Tidy is created by subsetting Dataset, selecting only columns: subject, code, and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:
	Entire numbers in the code column of the Tidy  returns the corresponding activity taken from the second column of the activities variable.

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names:
	code column in Tidy renamed into activities.
	All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer.
	All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope.
	All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body.
	All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude.
	All start with character f in the column’s name replaced by Frequency.
	All start with the character t in the column’s name replaced by Time.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject:
	Final is created by sumarizing Tidy taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after grouping by subject and activity.
	Export Final code into Final.txt file.
